It also uses the MIT License.  Eventually, I may need to have legal advice on these licenses for protect me and what ways those protections work.

Note: It is simpler on Mac to use Homebrew to load vagrant and its dependencies.

brew install hashicorp/tap/hashicorp-vagrant

Of course, one can always download binaries for the Intel/AMD64 Mac or ARM64 Mac depending architecture.  

One can discover Vagrant boxes at the following URL.

Watch out for reloading the vagrant boxes.   The configuration for port-forward might make things messy.  Try the guide from stack overflow:
